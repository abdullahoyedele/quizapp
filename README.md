This is the final project for #7DaysofCodeChallenge/Udacity program completion task for the ALC learners.
It is an educational app that quizzes a user about CURRENT AFFAIRS.
The quiz is a setup of five questions.
The code runs fine without errors and each question has a correct answer.
There are also grading and reset buttons, while the grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz and reveal the missed questions, the reset button button clears all the choosen answers for taking quiz again.
The app contains many views and layouts (nested).
The installable apk file for this app is available and downloadable here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-taKbYAs2diyEvCqe_q4HTbS7Z2c_651/view?ts=5b36e9ee
